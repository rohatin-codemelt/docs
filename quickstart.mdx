## Website Redeployment

### Content Types Requiring Redeployment

The following content types require website redeployment, which typically takes around 2-3 minutes:

- **Static Pages**: Any changes to static pages, such as about us or privacy policy, will necessitate a redeployment to ensure they reflect correctly on the website.

- **Casino Categories**: Modifying or adding new casino categories will trigger a redeployment to update the website's navigation and categorization.

- **Promotions**: Changes to promotions require redeployment to showcase the latest deals on the website.

### Real-Time Updates

For other content types, such as articles or news, changes made in the CMS are immediately reflected on the website upon saving. You can enjoy real-time updates without the need for a redeployment.

## Testing and Deployment Process

### Testing in Staging Environment

When adding new items or making significant changes, it's crucial to test them first in the staging environment to ensure they work as expected. Our staging environment is available at [77777bet.ro](http://77777bet.ro). Use this environment to verify content and functionality.

### Moving to Production

Once you are satisfied with the changes in the staging environment, you can proceed to move the items to the production environment for public access. Our production environment is [Casinomanhattan.ro](http://casinomanhattan.ro).

To manage content effectively:

1. Make changes in the staging environment at [CMS Staging](http://cms.77777bet.ro).

2. Test thoroughly to confirm everything works as intended.

3. After successful testing, move the content to the production environment at [CMS Production](http://cms.casinomanhattan.ro) for live access by the public.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your content is tested and ready for public consumption while maintaining a smooth and efficient content management process.
