# Nest.js Project - Feature Development Guide

## Introduction

This guide is designed to assist developers in understanding and implementing new features in our Nest.js project.

## Understanding Modules in Nest.js
[Modules](https://docs.nestjs.com/modules) are the fundamental building blocks of a Nest.js application. They encapsulate providers and controllers to organize the codebase.

## Current modules breakdown
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Exclusion">
    ### This module is responsible for the self exclusion feature
    When a user makes a request in the web application we save his request, sending him a confirmation email, followed by an email sent after 24 hours containg a link to deactivate his account
    <br/> <br/> The business logic for the cron jobs can be found at `src/exclusion/businesslogic.cron.ts`
    <br/> <br/> The logic for the service file can be found at `src/exclusion/exclusion.service.ts`, the service file is responsible for creating new exclusion requests, updating existing requests, fetching requests by the hash provided in the link
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Notification">
    ### This module is responsible for showing user notifications in the platform only once.
    The content displayed in the notiifcation is fetched from the cms by a webhook. The cms sends a post request verified by an api key that needs to match with the backend api key
    <br/> <br/> When a new notification is added on our backend we have a [Subscriber](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database#subscribers) `matchusers.subscriber.ts` that publishes a new job using Bull on redis to check eligible users for the notification
    <br/> <br/> the logic for eligible users can be found at `src/notifications/helpers/businesslogic.ts`
    <br/> <br/> the logic for the service file can be found at `src/notifications/noification.service.ts`, the service file is responsible for fetching new data from the cms, parsing it, saving in the database and updating read or unread notifications
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Everymatrix">
    ### This module is responsible for making requests to the everymatrix api
    ```typescript
    //this is the function that gets externalised, it fetches the user profile for a list of users
    public getListOfUsers = async (userIds: number[], sessionId: string): Promise<UserDTO[]> => {}

    //this function defines the logic for fetching the users
    private getUsersList = async ( userIds: number[], sessionId: string ): Promise<UserDTO[]> => {}

    //this function logins the admin in the api to get an admin session id
    public getSessionData = async (): Promise<SessionDataDTO | null> => {}

    //this function fetches the user profile for a single userid
    public getUserMetricsById = async ( userId: string, sessionId: string ): Promise<UserDTO | null> => {}

    //this function self excludes an user
    public excludeUser = async ( adminSession: string, userId: string, period: string ): Promise<boolean> => {}
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mailer">
   ### This module is responsible for sending email using SendGrid
   In order to change the email template or add new ones modify the enum located at `src/mailer/mailer.enum.ts` 
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Scheduler">
   ### This module is reponsible for scheduling cron jobs accros the platform
   you can find more details below
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="User">
   ## This module is responsible for creating or updating users that are saved in our database for notifications
   The logic for the cron job that checks for updates on user roles can be found at `businesslogic.cron.ts` located at `src/users/businesslogic.cron.ts`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## General File Structure for Modules
A typical module structure includes:
- `MODULE_NAME.module.ts`: The module file itself.
- `MODULE_NAME.service.ts`: Service file for business logic.
- `ENTITY_NAME.entity.ts`: Entity file defining the data model.
- `MODULE_SERVICE_NAME.service.ts`: Additional service files as needed.
<Warning>
  After creating a new module it must be inserted in the `app.module.ts` file
</Warning>

## Dependency Injection in Nest.js
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in Nest.js to increase modularity and flexibility, allowing classes to receive dependencies from external sources rather than creating them.
Learn more about [Dependecy injection](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers)

## Repositories in TypeORM
[Repositories](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/sql-typeorm#repository-pattern) are abstractions on top of the entity manager, providing additional methods for working with entities. They are used for data persistence and retrieval.

## Understanding Auth Guards
[Auth guards](https://docs.nestjs.com/guards) are used in Nest.js to protect routes and ensure that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints.

## EveryMatrix Auth Guard
The EveryMatrix auth guard checks the `session-id` and `user-id` against the EveryMatrix system for authenticated routes.
````typescript
class UserAuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  private readonly apiUrl: string
  public constructor() {
    if (!process.env.NORWAY_API_URL) { //saving the EM api URL
      throw new Error('Norway API url is not defined (NORWAY_API_URL)')
    }
    this.apiUrl = process.env.NORWAY_API_URL
  }
  async canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<boolean> {
    //fetching the session details for the user making the request
    const apiUrl = `${this.apiUrl}/v1/player/session/player` 
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest()
    const sessionId = request.headers['session-id']
    const userId = request.headers['user-id']
    const { data } = await axios.get(apiUrl, {
      headers: { 'X-SessionId': sessionId }
    })
    // Compare the header values
    if (userId == data.UserID) {
      return true // Allow the request to proceed
    } else {
      throw new UnauthorizedException('Unauthorized') // Deny the request
    }
  }
}
````

## Creating New Entities and Migrations in TypeORM

### Creating New Entities
Entities in TypeORM represent tables in your database. To create a new entity in our Nest.js project:

1. Create a new file in the `entities` folder, named `[ENTITY_NAME].entity.ts`.
2. Define the entity class with `@Entity()` decorator and specify the table structure using various decorators like `@Column()`.

### Generating Migrations
[Migrations](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database#migrations) are crucial for managing database schema changes. To generate a migration after creating or modifying entities:

<Steps>
<Step title="Creating Migrations Command">
Use the command `npm run migration:generate -- [name] [output location]`, replacing `[name]` with the name for the migration file and `[output location]` with the path where you want the migration file to be saved.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the migrations">
Use the provided command `npm run migration:run` to start the application locally.
</Step>
<Step title="Migration File Location">
Generated migrations are saved in the `./src/database/migrations` directory.
</Step>
</Steps>


## Running the Project Locally
<Steps>
<Step title="Install PostgreSQL and Redis">
Ensure [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/install/) are installed on your local machine.
</Step>
<Step title="Clone and Install Dependencies">
Clone the repository and install necessary dependencies using `npm` and `node version 18`
</Step>
<Step title="Run the Application">
Use the provided command `npm run start:dev` to start the application locally.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the migrations">
Use the provided command `npm run migration:run` to start the application locally.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Using SendGrid API
SendGrid API is used for handling email services. It requires proper setup and authentication to send emails.

## Cron Jobs with Bull Queue
Cron jobs in our project are managed using the Bull queue, which handles scheduled tasks efficiently while preventing multiple executions on the server.

### Adding New Cron Jobs
To add a new cron job:

<Steps>
<Step title="Add a new entry in the ScheduledJob enum">
locate the file scheduler.enum.ts and a new entry containg the name for your new cron job. Naming convention is `cron-[NAME_FOR_CRON_JOB]`
</Step>
<Step title="Define the Job in SchedulerProcessor">
Create a new method in the `SchedulerProcessor` class with the `@Process` decorator, specifying the job name and concurrency.
</Step>
<Step title="Example">
```typescript
@Process({
  name: ScheduledJob.YourNewJob,
  concurrency: 1
})
async handleYourNewJob(job: Job) {
  // the business logic will be defined in another file and here just a method call
  newFeatureBusinessLogic.yourNewJobLogic()
}
```
</Step>
</Steps>

### Changing the Cron Interval for Jobs
To change the cron interval:

<Steps>
<Step title="Modify the scheduleJob Method Call">
In the `SchedulerService` class, update the cron expression in the `scheduleJob` method call for the respective job.
</Step>
<Step title="Example">
```typescript
await this.scheduleJob({
  queue: this.cronJobQueue,
  jobName: ScheduledJob.ExclusionFirstStep,
  cron: 'New-Cron-Expression'
})
```
</Step>
</Steps>

Note: Ensure the cron expression is valid and matches the required format.
