# Strapi CMS Project - Feature Development Guide

## Introduction

This guide is intended to assist developers in understanding how to develop new features in our Strapi project, focusing on our usage of a headless CMS.

## What is a Headless CMS
A headless CMS is a content management system that provides an interface for creating and managing content but does not have a front-end system to display it. It allows for greater flexibility in delivering content to various platforms and devices.

## Running the Project Locally

### Setting Up the .env File
Ensure that the .env file is properly set up with all the necessary environment variables.

### Installing Dependencies for Plugins
<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Plugins Folder">
Go to the plugins folder in your project directory.
</Step>
<Step title="Install Dependencies">
Run the command to install dependencies for each plugin. Recommended command `yarn install` or `yarn` using `node version 18`
</Step>
</Steps>

### Building and Running Docker Compose
<Code language="bash">
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
</Code>

## Modifying Strapi Lifecycles
Strapi provides several lifecycle hooks like `beforeUpdate` and `beforeCreate` that allow you to execute custom logic.

## Handling 'Position' Property in Content Types
For content types with a 'position' property, add the following code:

````typescript
const { params, model } = event
const collectionId = model.uid
const { data } = params
const maxPosition = (await strapi.db.query(collectionId).findOne({
  select: ['position'],
  where: { locale: data.locale },
  orderBy: { position: 'desc' },
  limit: 1
}))?.position
````

## Creating New Collections or Single Types
Whenever a new collection or single type is created, ensure to update the documentation for the marketing team to reflect these changes.
