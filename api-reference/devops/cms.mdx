# Strapi CMS Project - Technical Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation aims to guide junior developers through the DevOps aspects of our Strapi CMS project. We utilize Strapi as a headless CMS, PM2 for process management, a PostgreSQL database, and a connection to our external production backend.

## Our Architecture

### Strapi Headless CMS
Strapi is the core of our content management, serving as a flexible and customizable headless CMS.

### PM2
PM2 is used to keep the Strapi application running continuously and manage its processes.

### PostgreSQL Database
Our data is stored in an external PostgreSQL database, which communicates through a private network.

### Production Backend Communication
The CMS communicates with our production backend over a public network, ensuring real-time data syncing and management.

## Environment Variables

### Changing the .env File
<Steps>
<Step title="Locate .env File">
Find the .env file in the root of the Strapi project.
</Step>
<Step title="Edit .env File">
Edit the .env file with the necessary changes using a text editor.
</Step>
<Step title="Save and Exit">
Save your changes and close the file.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Reloading .env Changes
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Reloading Environment Variables">
To apply changes made to the .env file without restarting Strapi:
1. Use PM2 to reload the application.
2. This will update the environment variables.

## Deployment Process
<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare for Deployment">
Ensure all changes, including .env modifications, are ready.
</Step>
<Step title="Execute Deploy Script">
Run the deploy.bash script to push changes to the server.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Logs and Monitoring

### Checking Logs with PM2
To view application logs, use:
```bash
pm2 logs [app-name]
```

### Using Grep with Logs
Filter specific log entries with grep:
```bash
pm2 logs [app-name] | grep [keyword]
```

## Modifying Deploy.bash for New Plugins
<Steps>
<Step title="Open deploy.bash">
Locate and open the deploy.bash file in your editor.
</Step>
<Step title="Add Plugin Installation Commands">
In the plugins section, add commands to install necessary packages for the new plugin.
````bash
cd CMS/
git fetch
git pull
cd ../
rm -r /var/node/cms
cp -a CMS/ /var/node/cms
cp .env /var/node/cms
cd /var/node/cms
NODE_ENV=production /usr/bin/yarn install
cd plugins/calendar
NODE_ENV=production /usr/bin/yarn install
cd ../new-plugin-folder-name   #<---- Here is an example of how to add a new plugin
NODE_ENV=production /usr/bin/yarn install #<---- Here is an example of how to add a new plugin
cd ../../
NODE_ENV=production /usr/bin/yarn build
NODE_ENV=production /usr/bin/pm2 reload default
````
</Step>
<Step title="Save and Close">
After adding the new commands, save your changes to the deploy.bash script.
