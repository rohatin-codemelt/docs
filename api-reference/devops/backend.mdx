# Backend Architecture Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide on our backend architecture, which utilizes a combination of Nest.js, PM2, Redis, PostgreSQL, and an external CMS.

## Our Architecture

### Nest.js Web API
Our main backend application is built using Nest.js, a progressive Node.js framework. It handles all our web API requests.

### PM2
PM2 is a process manager that keeps our Node.js applications alive forever and assists in managing application logging, monitoring, and clustering.

### Redis Server
We use an external Redis server for caching and session management. It communicates through a private network for enhanced security.

### PostgreSQL Database
Our primary data storage is a PostgreSQL database, also external and communicating through a private network.

### Production CMS
The backend interacts with a production CMS, which is external and communicates over a public network. This system manages content and user interactions.

## Environment Variables

### Changing the .env File
<Steps>
<Step title="Locate .env File">
The .env file is located in the root directory of the project. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to edit it.
</Step>
<Step title="Edit .env File">
Open the .env file in your preferred text editor and make the required changes.
</Step>
<Step title="Save Changes">
After editing, save the file. Ensure no syntax errors are introduced.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Changing the Password for Self-Exclusion Flow
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Editing the Self-Exclusion Password">
1. Open the .env file.
2. Locate the line that specifies the ADMIN_PASSWORD.
3. Change the value to the new password.
4. Save the file.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Editing the Self-Exclusion Email">
1. Open the .env file.
2. Locate the line that specifies the ADMIN_USERNAME.
3. Change the value to the new password.
4. Save the file.
<Warning>
The password must be changed every 30 days, this is a restriction from the EveryMatrix Backoffice
</Warning>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deployment Process
<Steps>
<Step title="Push Changes to Repository">
Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to the repository.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Deployment Script">
Execute the `deploy.bash` file with `sudo` permissions to apply the changes to the system.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Reloading Environment Variables
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Reloading .env Changes">
If you need to reload the .env changes without restarting the server, follow these steps:
1. Use PM2 to gracefully reload the application.
2. This will ensure the new environment variables are loaded without downtime.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Logs and Monitoring

### Checking Logs with PM2
Use the following command to view logs for a specific application:
```bash
pm2 logs [application-name]
```

### Filtering Logs with Grep
To filter logs, you can pipe PM2 logs into grep:
```bash
pm2 logs [application-name] | grep [search-term]
```

## Database Migrations

### Running Migrations
<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Server">
SSH into the server where the database is hosted.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Migration Command">
Navigate to the project directory and run the migration command `npm run migration:run`
</Step>
</Steps>

### Reverting Migrations
<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Server">
SSH into the server by accesing the hetzner web console or another desktop application of your choice
</Step>
<Step title="Run Revert Command">
Use the command to revert the last applied migration by using `npm run migration:revert`
</Step>
</Steps>
