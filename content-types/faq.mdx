# Managing FAQ in Strapi CMS

This content type allows you to organize FAQs into categories and subcategories, making it easy to provide structured and helpful information to your users. Each FAQ entry typically includes a title, slug URL for SEO-friendly links, and questions with detailed answers. By using the FAQ content type, you can efficiently maintain and display informative FAQs on your website, enhancing user experience and addressing common queries.
