## Description

Banners are an essential part of your platform, as they grab users' attention and convey important information. In Strapi CMS, banners allow you to display messages or advertisements in an organized manner. They can be scheduled for display, reordered with ease, and more. This guide explains how to effectively manage banners using Strapi.

### Display in the Platform

In the platform, banners are visible to users. They appear as a part of the platform's user interface, featuring titles, images, and links. The display and position of each banner are defined by the attributes you configure in Strapi CMS.
