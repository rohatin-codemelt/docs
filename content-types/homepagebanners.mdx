## Description

Banners are an essential part of your platform, as they grab users' attention and convey important information. In Strapi CMS, banners allow you to display messages or advertisements in an organized manner. They can be scheduled for display, reordered with ease, and more. This guide explains how to effectively manage banners using Strapi.

### Display in the Platform

In the platform, banners are visible to users. They appear as a part of the platform's user interface, featuring titles, images, and links. The display and position of each banner are defined by the attributes you configure in Strapi CMS.

In Strapi's Content Manager, banners are organized, making it easy to add, edit, and remove them. The CMS displays banners in a user-friendly format, allowing you to manage their content, schedule, and appearance effortlessly.

## Adding a New Banner

To add a new banner in Strapi:

1. Log in to your Strapi CMS account.

2. Navigate to the Content Manager by clicking "Content Manager" in the dashboard sidebar.

3. Find and select "MainBanner" in the list of content types.

## Scheduling Publication and Unpublication

Strapi's Publisher plugin allows you to schedule when banners should be published and unpublished. Here's how to do it:

1. In the banner detail view, locate the "Publishing" section.

2. Set the "Publish at" date and time to specify when the banner should go live.

3. Set the "Unpublish at" date and time to indicate when the banner should be removed from the platform.

4. Save your changes. The banner will be automatically published and unpublished according to the schedule you've set.

## Hiding a Banner

To temporarily hide a banner without deleting it:

1. In the banner detail view, locate the "Publishing" section.

2. Clear the "Publish at" and "Unpublish at" dates. This effectively hides the banner.

3. Save your changes. The banner will not be displayed on the platform until you reschedule its publication.
