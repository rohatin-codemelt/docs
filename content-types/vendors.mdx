# Managing Vendors in Strapi CMS

This guide will help you understand how to manage "Vendor" content in your Strapi CMS. Vendors are used to populate a slider at the top of your website, showcasing various providers. Each vendor entry consists of a name and a position to determine the order in which they appear.
