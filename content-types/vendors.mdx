# Managing Vendors in Strapi CMS

This guide will help you understand how to manage "Vendor" content in your Strapi CMS. Vendors are used to populate a slider at the top of your website, showcasing various providers. Each vendor entry consists of a name and a position to determine the order in which they appear.

2. You'll see a list of existing Vendor entries. To create a new one, click the "Add New Vendor Entry" button.

3. Fill in the following details for your new entry:
   - **Vendor Name**: Enter the name of the vendor. It must match the name provided by EveryMatrix exactly.
   - **Position**: Specify the order in which this method should appear (e.g., 1, 2, 3).

4. After entering the name, click the "Save" button to create the new Vendor entry.

To determine the order in which Vendor entries appear in the slider, follow these steps:

2. To reorder the entries, change the "Position" value of each entry. Lower numbers will appear first in the slider.

3. For example, set the "Position" of the most important vendor to "1," the next important vendor to "2," and so on.

4. Remember to save your changes to update the order of Vendor entries in the slider.
