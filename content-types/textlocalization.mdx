# Introduction

TextLocalization is a powerful feature in Strapi that allows you to manage and customize text content for different languages across your website. This guide will walk you through handling text data, adding new translations, removing text elements, adding new languages, and editing existing text content.

## How to Handle the Data

In Strapi, TextLocalization is a content type designed for handling small texts, such as button labels, pop-up messages, and various other text elements on your website. It ensures that these texts can be easily translated into multiple languages, making your website accessible to a broader audience.

## How the Data is Displayed

The text content managed through TextLocalization is dynamically displayed on your website based on the chosen language or locale. When a user selects a specific language, the corresponding text content will be presented to them.
